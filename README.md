# Linear PR Check

Simple action that checks that a PR contains a Linear issue linked through Linear's supported mechanisms.

Linear supports four ways to link issues with your pull requests:

1. Include `*issue ID*` in the branch name
2. Include `*issue ID*` in the PR title
3. Include `*issue ID*` with a magic word in the PR description (e.g., `Fixes ENG-123`) similar to GitHub Issues
4. **Include the issue URL in the PR description** (e.g., `https://linear.app/yourteam/issue/ENG-123/issue-title`)
