# Linear PR Check

Simple action that checks that a PR contains a Linear issue linked through Linear's supported mechanisms:

Linear supports three ways to link issues with your pull requests:

1. Include `*issue ID*` in the branch name
1. Include `*issue ID*` in the PR title
1. Include `*issue ID*` with a magic word in the PR description (e.g. `Fixes ENG-123`) similar to GitHub Issues
